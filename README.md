This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code puzzles. I started solving them in [2020](#2020), and I'm continuing to do so in [2022](#2022), [2023](#2023), and [2024](#current-2024). So far, I didn't have time to solve all the puzzles in a given year, especially when work gets busy, puzzles get harder and it’s time to prepare for Christmas. Hoping this year will be different. 🤞

## About AoC

From the [subreddit Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/index):

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

You can access the problems here: [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/). It will show you the most recent problems. If you want to access other year just type [adventofcode.com/2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) for the year 2019.

## Current: 2024

For `AoC 2024` I will solve the problems in `Python` (and sometimes I'll add `Bash` solution). Each day's solution is linked to its rendered HTML output and notebook source.

For an overview of my journey and insights, check out my [blog post on AoC 2024](https://kasia.codes/posts/aoc24/). ✍️

For `AoC 2023` I am solving them in Python, in Jupyter notebooks (run in VS Code). I don't keep the inputs, as per the request of the creator of Advent of Code. I have GitHub Copilot running in VS Code, but only use it for autocompletion, the ideas for solutions and their implementation is mine. I also use GitHub Copilot for doc strings and minor improvements after I solve the tasks.

For `AoC 2022` I decided to solve the problems by writing up my solutions in Quarto Publication (so far using `Python`). You can look up the answers in the online version of the notebook [here](https://kzkedzierska.quarto.pub/advent-of-code-2022/).

In 2020, I solved `AOC 2020` challenges using `R` with solutions organised and split into subdirectories, you can check them out [here](/2020).
