# My Advent of Code (AoC) solutions

## 2023 

For `AoC 2023` I am solving them in Python, in Jupyter notebooks (run in VS Code). I don't keep the inputs, as per the request of the creator of Advent of Code. I have GitHub Copilot running in VS Code, but only use it for autocompletion, the ideas for solutions and their implementation is mine. I also use GitHub Copilot for doc strings and minor improvements after I solve the tasks.

## 2022

For `AoC 2022` I decided to solve the problems by writing up my solutions in Quarto Publication (so far using `Python`). You can look up the answers in the online version of the notebook [here](https://kzkedzierska.quarto.pub/advent-of-code-2022/).

## 2020
In 2020, I solved `AOC 2020` challenges using `R` with solutions organised and split into subdirectories, you can check them out [here](/2020).


## About AOC

From the [subreddit Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/index): Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

You can access the problems here: [adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/). It will show you the most recent problems. If you want to access other year just type [adventofcode.com/2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) for the year 2019.

This repository contains my solutions to Advent of Code exercises. Usually, during Christmas holiday break I take some time to solve few problems from Advent of Code. Decided to keep the code tidy and put it on GitHub for future reference.
