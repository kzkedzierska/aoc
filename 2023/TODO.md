## Unsolved

Those days that are not solved on the day, but rather solved later for various reasons.

- [ ] [Day 5](2023/Day05.ipynb) Part Two
- [x] [Day 6](2023/Day06.ipynb)
- [x] [Day 7](2023/Day07.ipynb)
- [ ] Day 8
- [ ] Day 9
- [ ] Day 10
- [ ] Day 11
- [ ] Day 12 (might be difficult, saw some memes on Reddit)  
- [ ] Day 13

## Solved, but can be improved
- [ ] [Day 6](2023/Day06.ipynb): Optimize the solution, currently part 2 takes about 11 s. I believe it can be faster.
